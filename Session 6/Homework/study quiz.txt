1. Why should we use functions at all?
   Because functions help us organize programs into chunks that match how we think about the problem

2. How to define/declare a function?
   The syntax for a function definition is:
   def NAME( PARAMETERS ):
      STATEMENTS

3. How to call/use a function?
   Function calls contain the name of the function being executed followed by a list of values, called arguments, which are assigned to the parameters in the function definition

4. What is return, why and how do we use it?
   A function that returns a value is called a fruitful function. The return statement is followed an expression. This expression will be
evaluated and returned to the caller as the “fruit” of calling this function.

5. Do we have to use return in every function?
   No

6. What are function arguments/parameters, why and how we use it?
   Most functions require arguments: the arguments provide for generalization. For example, if we want to find the absolute value of a number, we have to indicate what the number is. 
Inside the function, the values that are passed get assigned to variables called parameters.
>>> abs(5)
5
>>> abs(-5)
5
In this example, the arguments to the abs function are 5 and -5.

7. How to use function from a different file other than our currently working file?
   We can use function to call another functions. For example, if we already have a function that draws a rectangle, so we can use that to draw our square.

def draw_square(tx, sz): # A new version of draw_square
   draw_rectangle(tx, sz, sz)
